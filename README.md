### About the game

The game has three areas i.e. ***Grass***, ***Stone*** and ***Water***. The player loads on a piece of grass. The objective of the game is for the player to cross the Stone blocks and reach the Water body. Bugs crawl over the stone blocks at varying speeds. Our player is allergic to these bugs, so the game restarts if the player and the bug collides. The player can move ***up***, ***down***, ***right*** and ***left*** to reach the water body. There are also 2 stars during the game that the player can collect to maximize his/her score.

### About scoring and collecting stars
* When the player moves to the first stone layer which exactly above the grass, he recieves 100 points. When he agains moves up, he recieves 200 points, thus 300 in total. Finally when he reaches the top most stone layer he recieves 300 points thus 600 in total. 
* When the player collects a star he recieves an additional 300 points.
